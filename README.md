# thimble
A tiny web framework for MicroPython. Similar in spirit to Flask, but scaled back to fit on a microcontroller.

Copy thimble.py to your MicroPython powered microcontroller. Use main.py to test.

Using the example main.py assumes that networking is already configured by a boot.py that you supply. If you need help with that, see my example under [lolin32oled](https://github.com/DavesCodeMusings/esp/tree/main/lolin32oled)

Code developed and tested using an ESP32 with MicroPython 1.19.1
